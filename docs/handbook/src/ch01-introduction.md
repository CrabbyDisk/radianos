## 1.2 The History

So back in the early days when i was having fun with Arch Linux and Debian, I wanted to make and have something of my own so i wanted to make
my own linux system and thats how i started researching and named my linux distro **RedianOS** and i chose debian as a base distro and so in the name **Debian**
I replaced the D with R and B with D and it became Redian , and this was around August 2023, by September of 2023 , I showed the project to the school and it was a great success
the school Principal liked it alot. Eventually they say everything has to come to an end and before final touch ups to the system, on a sunday morning i booted my laptop up and i was using Windows at that time
so when i booted my system , windows basically threw me to the setup screen and i had backup points there for some reason and i chose the wrong one and i lost Redian forever and thats how the RedianOS which was initially
A debian based distro ended , now i started dualbooting linux with windows and decided to revive the project in 2024 as a independent linux distro and i did alot of work , people recommended Rust and thats what i was using
in the ***wrong way*** because i did not understand the Rust book, and I saw the drama happening around Linux with Rust and the once love for Linux now turned into hatred , i started hating linux for not using newer technologies in it
even though it was known to have rapid development around newer technologies , the old people just simply loved C and called Rust users *gay* and C users as Sigmas and Gigachads , real men and what not. So I made Radian go totally independent
with it not being **UNIX** or unix-like and not even **POSIX** compilant , what that means that Radian would be an own thing in itself since UNIX and POSIX are very old.
